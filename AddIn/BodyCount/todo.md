# Things yet to do

- Write Add In
    - Fusion commands
        - Define strings
            - Could have a synchronised "default strings" variable
        - UI:
            - Command box (ie. buttons, input boxes etc.)
        - Functionality:
            - Table of strings to include in this project.
            - Maybe also assign bodies/components in this command?
    - Excel output
        - Get path to excel document, find proper sheet and populate sheet with data.
        - Should perform some assertions on sheet, to make sure tables are formatted correctly.
        - UI:
            - Command box (ie. buttons, input boxes etc.)
        - Functionality:
            - Collect count of bodies/components in each string.
            - Output counts to excel document.
                - This will probably be a seperate well defined module.
    - Global "synchronised" variables (fx. list of materials)
        - Could use OneDrive or Dropbox to synchronise variables between devices.
